# The lovely Minecraft PS3 PvP Community from my pov:  

- Mojang publishing random updates which doesn't do shit but takes more storage.

- Sony still trying to ban users whose hop on mmCM and still trying to secure ps3 from jailbreak.

- **PSN-Support** not giving support.

- People who kick you from their host because they dont know how to play.

- No-lifers refusing to rematch, claiming to have a life after clipping others while they're trying to feel nostalgia—then uploading a **r*pe series** video to their channel.  

- RF users (autoclickers) claiming to be legit while producing the most sharpness particles during their vid while comboing someone *__same goes for PS4__*. And those with RF history claiming they don't use it anymore, but in every VC, they be saying **cba to click anymore**.

- Hispanics opening their mic and saying **f*ck you** after losing a fight but at the same time having the **top1 clan** on PS3, whose player base nowadays isn't going above **10**.  

- French people flooding servers... letting themselves combo each other for a video and shit-talking like they've been here forever since.  

- And of course... gotta love those so-called **devs** in the Minecraft PS3 community who keep releasing **__clients__** *(SPRX)*, making the tiny-ass dead community even worse by just pasting code from each other *(EVEN PAID AT SOME POINT LOOOL)*. And later, they **quit**, open-source their **project**, but it's flooded with errors and issues—not even f*cking usable.  THEN these ppl tryna **revive** the community :joy: 

- Especially those **backup devs**, claiming to be devs, whose only job is to change images in a PCK/ARC file using a decompiler :joy::joy::joy::joy:  

- Then the gay owner of PCK Studio, named **PhoenixARC**, banning me for absolutely no reason cuz he/she or they or whatever the f*ck his transgender ass identifies as; couldn't be asked to hear one of my friends calling him out for skidding, having the biggest ego anyone could potentially have in this community.

I'm not sure how y'all still enjoy this game or PS3 in general. Get a f*cking job.
